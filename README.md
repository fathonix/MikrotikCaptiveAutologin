# Mikrotik Captive Autologin

This Node.js script automates logging into [Mikrotik](https://mikrotik.com) captive portal.

To add more security, Mikrotik captive portal appends some random bytes and encodes the transmitted password to MD5.
This script retrieves the bytes, appends and encodes the password, then sends it to the captive portal.

## Configuration

Create `config.json` inside the script folder, like this:

```json
[
    {
        "ssid": "<wifi name>",
        "hostname": "<captive portal hostname without http://>",
        "username": "<your username>",
        "password": "<your password>"
    }
]
```

You can add multiple configurations for different SSIDs.

`cd` to the folder and install the dependencies.

    npm install

Then run this script.

    npm run start
